## MAKS - Motion Averaging
MAKS contains routines for pose graph optimization and rotation averaging. Still under development!

### Dependencies
* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) : Header-only library used for matrix operations and linear algebra solvers.
* [Intel速 oneAPI MKL](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/components/onemkl.html#gs.cq3i6h) : Free proprietary math library.

### Compiling (C++)
The first thing you need to know is that the MATLAB code is independent from C++. So no need to compile anything!

The C++ code depends on the Eigen library for matrix operations and Intel速 oneApi MKL for the PARDISO sparse solvers and BLAS.

We provide a (hopefully) fast way of compiling everything. Jus run the shell script install.sh
This script will try to locate everything needed and compile the code with either icc or g++
If you run into trouble, edit the paths for Eigen and for your installation of oneAPI MKL.

### Datasets

The datasets are provided as .g2o files. You will find certain datasets with a naming convention like "\_SO3.g2o". These were the ones used in our ICCV paper on Rotation Averaging. The difference between e.g., sphere.g2o and sphere_SO3.g2o is that the former was cleaned of repeated edges.
