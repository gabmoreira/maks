## MAKS - Motion Averaging
MAKS contains routines for pose graph optimization and rotation averaging.

### Dependencies
* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) : Header-only library used for matrix operations and linear algebra solvers.
* [Intel速 oneAPI MKL](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/components/onemkl.html#gs.cq3i6h) : Free proprietary math library.

### Compiling (C++)
The first thing you need to know is that the MATLAB code is independent from C++. So no need to compile anything!  

The C++ code depends on the Eigen library for matrix operations and Intel速 oneApi MKL for the PARDISO sparse solvers and BLAS.

We provide a (hopefully) fast way of compiling everything. Just run.   
`source install.sh`  

This script will try to locate everything needed and compile the code with either `icc` or `g++`.    
If you run into trouble, edit the paths for Eigen and for your installation of oneAPI MKL in the shell script.  

The executable has the name `ravess_example`.  

To run:  
`./ravess_example ../data/sphere_SO3.g2o`

### Datasets

The datasets are provided as .g2o files. You will find certain datasets with a naming convention like "\_SO3.g2o". These were the ones used in our ICCV paper [1]. The difference between e.g., sphere.g2o and sphere_SO3.g2o is that the latter was cleaned of repeated edges and has no vertex/node information, only edge measurements.
